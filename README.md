# Regex-Tutorial
Week 17 Homework

A regex, which is short for regular expression, is a sequence of characters that defines a specific search pattern. When included in code or search algorithms, regular expressions can be used to find certain patterns of characters within a string, or to find and replace a character or sequence of characters within a string. They are also frequently used to validate input.

For the purpose of this tutorial, we will explain the function of each character in the below regex, which matches an email. /^([a-z0-9_.-]+)@([\da-z.-]+).([a-z.]{2,6})$/ This RegEx would typically be used to verify that a correct email address has been entered by the user.
